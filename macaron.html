  <p>My personal favorite, the famous French dessert. Just the perfect snack after a delicious meal. Both savory and sweet.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  
<li>6 large egg whites</li>
<br>
<li>1-1/2 cup hazelnuts, toasted</li>
<br>
<li>2-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
<br>
<li>Dash salt</li>
<br>
<li>1/2 cup superfine sugar</li>
<br>
<h3>Buttercream:</h3>
<br>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<br>
<li>6 tbs water</li>
<br>
<li>6 large egg yolks</li>
<br>
<li>4 tsp instant espresso powder</li>
<br>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<br>
<li>1-1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
<br>
<li>6 tbs confectioners' sugar</li>
<br>
<h3>Directions:</h3>

  <li>1. Place egg whites in a small bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
<br>
  <li>2. Preheat oven to 350°. Place hazelnuts and confectioners' sugar in a food processor; pulse until nuts are finely ground.</li>
<br>
  <li>3. Add salt to egg whites; beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add superfine sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high until stiff peaks form. Fold in hazelnut mixture.</li>
<br>
  <li>4. With a pastry bag, pipe 1-in.-diameter cookies 2 in. apart onto parchment-lined baking sheets.</li>
<br>
  <li>5. Bake until lightly browned and firm to the touch, 9-12 minutes. Transfer cookies on the parchment to wire racks; cool completely.</li>
<br>
  <li>6. For the buttercream, in a heavy saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil; cook over medium-high heat until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat. In a small bowl, whisk a small amount of hot syrup into egg yolks; return all to pan, whisking constantly. Cook until thickened, 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly; remove from heat. Stir in espresso powder and vanilla; cool completely.</li>
<br>
  <li>7. In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat butter until creamy. Gradually beat in cooled syrup. Beat in confectioners' sugar until fluffy. Refrigerate until mixture firms to a spreading consistency, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <br>
  <li>8. Spread about 1-1/2 tsp buttercream onto the bottoms of half the cookies; top with remaining cookies. Store in airtight containers in the refrigerator.</li>
